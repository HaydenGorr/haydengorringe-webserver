## Employment history


### 2022 - Present, Freelance, Android and iOS app developer

As of the time of writing, I have worked with 2 clients in developing mobile apps for their businesses. I have written Swift in Xcode to develop iOS apps, and Kotlin in Android Studio for Android apps.

For the SensorStory client, I wrote a powerful API in the backend to furnish each instance of the app with user data pulled from a MySQL database.

Please check out the Sensor Story Baby Classes app on the Google play store or the App Store for an example of my work.


### 2021 - Present, GlobalStep, QA Engineer/Front-end Developer

At GlobalStep I am contracted out as a QA engineer to various clients, my largest being a U.S.-based telecommunications company called Nextiva. 

My role for all clients involves interfacing with project managers and development teams to create test coverage, implement testing infrastructure, ensure that the tests are up-to-date throughout development and that they run and produce results when they’re required to.

For some clients I’ve lead a team and taken more of a managerial role. In this role I’ve performed extensive performance testing, functional testing, API testing, test creation, testing architecture design. Here is a list of some of the technologies I’ve used in this role: Javascript, Cypress, Selenium, Docker, Jenkins, React, SQL, JMeter.

_Some additional information_: I am also in charge of programming and automation training at GlobalStep.


### 2019 - 2020, Gentrack, Graduate Software Developer, 

At Gentrack I worked as part of a team maintaining and developing billing and management software for our client _OVO Energy_. 

The responsibilities of each member of my team is the same. We must communicate with the customer (OVO Energy), understand their needs from a technical level as well as the high level in which their needs are usually delivered, communicate them to our team, fit them into the workflow as tasks, pick a task, solve it, deliver it.

We work according to agile principles, and specifically manage our development in the Scrum framework.

Except for Jira, Confluence, Slack, and notepad++, all of the tools we used for development, including the programming language, are proprietary.
