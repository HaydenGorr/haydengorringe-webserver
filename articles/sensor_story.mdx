### What is Sensor Story?
**Sensor Story Baby Classes** - to give it its full name - is a montessori based group for babies to toddlers based in North-West London. 

For a local montessori business a fully integrated multi-platform app is a rare thing, but not for lack of necessity. It's actually proven highly valuable with over 200 downloads. It leant credibility to the fledgling business, gave regular attendants a speedy means of accessing account data and class data.

### Where can I see the app?

*Please note that because of an unpaid api bill on the part of the business owner, the app is currently not functioning at full capacity.*

### Can we see the code?
If given a reasonable request I can share *some* of the code, but the repository is private for obvious reasons.

### How is the app maintained?
I have integrated the app with [rollbar](https://rollbar.com/), a very handy error logging service. Any error experienced by a user is logged along with basic phone metadata such as OS version, make & model, is logged along with severity.
