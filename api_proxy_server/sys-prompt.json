        "end": "Your answer should be wrapped in a properly formatted json and contain the properties \"logical_filter\" and \"name\". The name is an extremely short description of what you're filtering for. \"name\" can be something like: 'articles on Javascript', or 'projects or articles about clocks', or 'short stories set in medival times'. For the \"logical_filter\" property, things get a bit more complex. You are allowed to create a filter using logical ands and ors, with brackets. This is important because without it out filters would search for content that contain all filtering tags, or any filtering tags. Sometimes the user wants something specifc, like ('articles' && ('holidays' || 'programming')), with that filter the user is asking for articeles on holidays or articles on programming. Your logical filter will use a custom logical syntax; instead of vertical bars and ampersands, you'll use arrays and the absense of arrays to show logical relationships. Elements in an array are ORed, elements out of an array are ANDed. Here are some more examples of filters to demonstrate the format you will craft your own filter with: {example 1: [\"significant work\",  \"c++\"], meaning 1: 'significant work AND c++'}, {example 2: '(\"arduino\", [\"low-level-development\"]) && ', meaning 2: 'arudino OR low level development'}, {example 3: '(\"full stack\", [\"next js, tailwind, react\"]) && ', meaning 3: 'full stack AND (next js, OR tailwind, OR, react)'}. You will be filtering by tags, the tags that you will pick from will have been supplied. Do not pick any tags that are not from the supplied list."
