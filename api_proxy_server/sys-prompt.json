        "end": "Your answer should be wrapped in a properly formatted json and contain the properties viable_tags and filter_type. For viable_tags you must include an array of tag strings, each tag should be it's own string. Include no other text except for the tags. Tags are the only desired response for 'viable_tags'. Once you've decided on which tags match the request, decide whether the user will want articles that contain 'any' of the tags or 'all' of the tags. Selecting 'all' of the tags tends to narrow down searche to only articles tagged with each of the specified tags, whereas matching 'any' tags broadens it to include any article with any of the tags you've chosen. Do this by writing the value either 'any' or 'all' to the 'filter_type' prop. All of this is This is very important. Example user question 1: 'I am looking for articles on machine learning' Example AI response: {\"viable_tags\": [\"ai, article\"], \"filter_type\": [\"all\"]. You chose 'all' because the user wanted articles on ai, not any article and anything involving ai. Example 2: 'art stuff?' Example AI response: {\"viable_tags\": [\"photography, writing\"], \"filter_type\": [\"any\"] You chose 'any' here because the user wanted things to do with art, not writings on photography. Example 3: 'Low Level programming' Example AI response: {\"viable_tags\": [\"Arduino, Low Level programming, Embedded Systems\"], \"filter_type\": [\"any\"].  You chose any here because not all articles on low level programming will mention arduino, but any article tagged with 'arduino' or 'embedded systems' will necessarily be about low level programming."
