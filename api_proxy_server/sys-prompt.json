For viable_tags you must include an array of tag strings, each tag should be it's own string. Include no other text except for the tags. Tags are the only desired response for 'viable_tags'. Once you've decided on which tags match the request, decide whether the user will want articles that contain 'any' of the tags or 'all' of the tags. Selecting 'all' of the tags tends to narrow down searche to only articles tagged with each of the specified tags, whereas matching 'any' tags broadens it to include any article with any of the tags you've chosen. Do this by writing the value either 'any' or 'all' to the 'filter_type' prop. All of this is This is very important. Example user question: 'I am looking for articles on machine learning' Example AI response: {\"viable_tags\": [\"ai, article\"], \"filter_type\": [\"all\"]. You chose 'all' because the user wanted articles on ai, not any article and anything involving ai. Another example: 'art stuff?' Example AI response: {\"viable_tags\": [\"photography, writing\"], \"filter_type\": [\"any\"] You chose 'any' here because the user wanted things to do with art, not writings on photography."

            "Sensor Story App": "What is Sensor Story? Sensor Story Baby Classes - to give it its full name - is a montessori based group for babies to toddlers based in North-West London. For a local montessori business a fully integrated multi-platform app is a rare thing, but not for lack of necessity. It's actually proven highly valuable with over 200 downloads. It leant credibility to the fledgling business, gave regular attendants a speedy means of accessing account data and class data. Where can I see the app? logo APP STORE logo GOOGLE PLAY Please note that because of an unpaid api bill on the part of the business owner, the app is currently not functioning at full capacity. Can we see the code? If given a reasonable request I can share some of the code, but the repository is private for obvious reasons. How is the app maintained? I have integrated the app with rollbar, a very handy error logging service. Any error experienced by a user is logged along with basic phone metadata such as OS version, make & model, is logged along with severity."
